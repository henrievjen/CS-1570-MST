1.

1) The teacher calls the first student.

2) All of the student(s) that have been called call another student while
the teacher calls another student.

3) Repeat step 2 four additional times.


2. 

1) Check if the monetary value is greater than $125.33, if it is, output
that the operation is not possible.

2) Check if the monetary value is divisible by 9, if it is, output that the
operation is not possible.

3) Make three tally charts: one for quarters, one for dimes, and one for
pennies.

4) Subtract 25 cents from the monetary value.

5) If the original monetary value is still positive and greater than 0, add
a tally to the quarters chart and repeat steps 4 and 5 until the monetary
value is negative or equals 0.

6) If the monetary value equals 0, output that the operation is possible and
state the coin combination reading how many of each coin there are based on
the tally chart and end the algorithm.

7) If the monetary value is negative, add the 25 cents back on to the
original monetary value.

8) Repeat steps 4, 5, 6, and 7, but where the word quarter is used, replace
it with dime. Where the value 25 cents is used, replace it with 10 cents.

8) Then repeat steps 4, 5, 6, and 7, but where the word dime is used,
replace it with penny. Where the value 10 cents is used, replace it with 1
cent.


3.

1) Check if the right side of Roger is blocked.

2) If Roger is at Dr. Frank's Prostheses and Garden shop, finish the
algorithm.

3) If the right is not blocked, move right one space and go back to step
number 1.

4) Check if the front is blocked.

5) If Roger is at Dr. Frank's Prostheses and Garden shop, finish the
algorithm.

6) If the front is not blocked, move forward one space and go back to step
number 1.

7) Check if the left is blocked.

8) If Roger is at Dr. Frank's Prostheses and Garden shop, finish the
algorithm.

9) If the left is not blocked, move left one space and go back to step
number 1.

10) Move backwards one space and turn around and go back to step number 1.
